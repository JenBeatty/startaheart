		<h2 class="accordion_subsection_less sca_head">What is SCA?
		</h2>
		<p class="more_content">SCA stands for sudden cardiac arrest. SCA is the sudden cessation 
		of the effective pumping action of the heart. The normal heartbeat stops and is most frequently 
		replaced with an irregular, useless twitching state of the muscles of the heart’s chambers, 
		called the ventricles. This heart rhythm is called ventricular fibrillation or ventricular 
		tachycardia. Consequently, blood and oxygen are no longer circulating to the brain and body.
		
		<h2 class="accordion_subsection_less sca_head">
		How is SCA different than a heart attack?
		</h2>
		<p class="more_content">Sudden cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack. A heart attack 
		occurs when there is interruption of blood flow to a portion of the heart, and that part of the 
		heart starts to die due to a lack of oxygen. The majority of heart attacks are due to a blockage 
		in one of the arteries that supplies blood to a specific area of the heart. A heart attack victim 
		will usually be able to talk and respond to bystanders. If a heart attack occurs, it can trigger 
		ventricular fibrillation and SCA. More than 80% of cases of SCA occur in people who have 
		significant heart disease.
		</p>
		
		<h2 class="accordion_subsection_less sca_head">What is the first sign of SCA?
		</h2>
		<p class="more_content">The first thing someone will do when they experience SCA is pass out. 
		They will also stop breathing normally, although they may be gasping or moaning. Since they 
		are no longer getting blood and oxygen to the brain, they have only 4-6 minutes before they 
		will start to experience brain damage, and soon after that, brain death. For each minute that 
		passes without oxygen being delivered to the brain and body, there is an incremental 10% decrease 
		in the chance of survival.
		</p>
		
		<h2 class="accordion_subsection_less sca_head">How is SCA treated?
		</h2>
		<p class="more_content">The majority of SCA is due to erratic, twitching heart behavior, and the 
		definitive treatment for that is defibrillation. Defibrillation means delivering a high dose 
		electrical shock that stops the heart from quivering and allows it to regain a normal heart 
		rhythm. This shock must be administered quickly, before the brain begins to die. With fire 
		and ambulance response times being anywhere from 4 to 20 minutes (depending on your location), 
		having access to early defibrillation is the key to surviving SCA.
		</p>
		
		<h2 class="accordion_subsection_less sca_head">How can AEDs in our community help SCA?
		</h2>
		<p class="more_content">Currently, only 5 out of every 100 Americans (5%) who experience SCA 
		survive. SCA kills more Americans each year than breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, 
		and AIDS combined. Approximately 900 Americans die each day due to complications from SCA. In 
		places with strong AED programs and CPR training, such as the Las Vegas casinos, survival 
		rates jump to over 50%. Communities with strong CPR training programs, such as Rochester, 
		Minnesota, place AEDs in police cars, local parks, recreation centers, schools, and at sporting 
		fields – resulting in survival rates as high as 43%. Access to early defibrillation and knowing 
		CPR has been proven to save lives.
